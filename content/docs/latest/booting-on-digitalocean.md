# Running Flatcar Linux on DigitalOcean

Note that official Flatcar Linux images are not available on Digital Ocean at the moment. You can run Flatcar today by


* installing Container Linux (following the official [Container Linux on Digital Ocean](https://github.com/coreos/docs/blob/master/os/booting-on-digitalocean.md) and then
* [upgrading to Flatcar from from Container Linux](./update-from-container-linux.md).
