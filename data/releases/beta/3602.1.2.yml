  body: " _Changes since **Beta 3602.1.1**_\r\n \r\n #### Security fixes:\r\n \r\n\
    \ - Linux ([CVE-2023-3338](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3338), [CVE-2023-3390](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3390))\r\
    \n \r\n #### Bug fixes:\r\n \r\n - Ensured that the folder `/var/log/sssd` is\
    \ created if it doesn't exist, required for `sssd.service` ([Flatcar#1096](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1096))\r\
    \n - Worked around a bash regression in `flatcar-install` and added error reporting\
    \ for disk write failures ([Flatcar#1059](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1059))\r\
    \n \r\n #### Changes:\r\n \r\n - Changed ext4 inode size of root partition to\
    \ 256 bytes. This improves compatibility with applications and is necessary for\
    \ 2038 readiness ([Flatcar#1082](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1082))\r\
    \n \r\n #### Updates:\r\n \r\n - Linux ([5.15.119](https://lwn.net/Articles/936675)\
    \ (includes [5.15.118](https://lwn.net/Articles/935584)))\r\n - ca-certificates\
